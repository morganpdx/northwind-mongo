## Northwind@MongoDB ##

### What it is

* Just a simple data dump from SQL's Northwind database to a CSV
* CSV (northwind.csv) turned into multiple CSVs
* CSVs imported into Mongo (mongo-import.sh)
* All CSVs except northwind.csv data scrubbed

Thanks to [@shayden](https://github.com/shayden) for the csv dump. 
Thanks to [@tmcnab] (https://github.com/tmcnab) for the dump into mongo
